                    <h2>I Can No Longer In Good Conscience Eat Meat After Seeing That Tic-Tac-Toe-Playing Chicken At The County Fair</h2> 
                    <img src="http://subversify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/chicken-011-e1521400545500.jpg">
                    <p><i>September 3rd, 2018 </i><br>I’ve been a meat eater for 52 years. That’s the way my parents raised me. Chicken, pork, beef, lamb—I ate it all, never giving much thought to where my food actually came from. But something happened to me recently that changed all of that. I witnessed something so incredible, so profound, that I can truly say my relationship with food will never be the same. I have come to the realization that eating animals is unethical following an encounter with a chicken that has the remarkable ability to play tic-tac-toe. Last weekend, I attended the Van Buren County Fair expecting the festivities to be like any other year. I’d go on a few rides, play a few games, perhaps enjoy a funnel cake. But then I came across the Bird Brain Challenge. It was a booth that allowed visitors to play tic-tac-toe against a chicken, and it was one of the most amazing—and revelatory—sights I have ever beheld. As the chicken took turns with its opponents, pecking at a little metal box, I perceived in its gaze an unmistakable intelligence and dignity. I began to realize these birds possessed wisdom, memory, and self-awareness. I no longer viewed them as “just animals,” but as cognizant, complex entities capable of reason and choice. Suddenly, the idea of a carnivorous diet began to seem like a barbaric, grotesque relic of the past. Watching that chicken contemplate where to place its next O, I was forever transformed. At that moment, I knew I would never again raise a forkful of animal flesh to my mouth. Here was a creature that, just like us, could play a game of tic-tac-toe. Just like us, it could think strategically about whether to go for the center box or one of the corner ones. So how could caging, slaughtering, and consuming it possibly be moral? When I made the connection between the animals I often grilled in my backyard and the animal before me able to score three in a row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, it shook me to my very core.
                            Over the years, I’d seen PETA commercials and news reports on factory farming, but those arguments for vegetarianism had never won me over. It didn’t click for me until I looked at that chicken and realized there was a soul in there, one that had hopes, dreams, and a firm understanding of how to limit your opponent’s options by making a strong opening move. These birds aren’t something to be put in a can of soup or on a plate with blue cheese and buffalo sauce. They are sentient beings that can think, emote, and make the judgment to play things safe and aim for a draw after realizing a win is infeasible given the current layout of Xs.
                            I have always believed our ability to play a three-by-three grid strategy game was part of what made us unique as humans. Now, I have been forced to discard this conviction. I have seen a chicken abandon a diagonal approach and instead make a play for the left-hand vertical line, a move so cunning it would never have occurred to me. Chickens know how to plan ahead in order to lure their opponent into an unwise move—I have witnessed it myself. Would you eat me? Of course not. Then why eat an animal that can consistently outmaneuver me at tic-tac-toe?
                            Even if I tried, I couldn’t bring myself to eat meat again. After I left the fair’s tic-tac-toe booth, my stomach turned at the sight of those around me mindlessly chomping on their turkey legs. Now, every time I pass a KFC, my mind flashes back to Clucky the Bird Genius, as complex and sensitive a creature as I have ever known.
                            The sign advertising the attraction prompted fairgoers with the question, “Are you smarter than a chicken?” What it should have asked is, “Are you more human than one?”

                            <i>September 2nd, 2018</i> <br>STOCKTON, CA—Displaying great courage in the face of looming catastrophe, electrician Tyler Pendleton narrowly averted the complete collapse of society Tuesday by honking his horn at a car that had paused briefly at a green light. “Jesus Christ, you dipshit!” Pendleton said as part of his selfless defense of our greatest ideals, underscoring and reinforcing his horn’s furious, arrhythmic honking and almost certainly preventing a massive traffic jam that would have inevitably ripped asunder the very fabric of civilization. “It’s green, you idiot, come on! Get off your damn phone and keep your eyes on the road! God, nobody in this fucking city knows how to drive.” Having single-handedly restored order after our very way of life teetered for five breathless seconds on the brink of chaos, the ever-vigilant Pendleton immediately threw himself back into the defense of all that is good and pure by tailgating a motorist who was hampering the progress of all humankind by driving only five miles per hour above the posted speed limit.

                            <i>September 1st, 2018</i> <br>PORTLAND, OR—In response to their competitor Nike’s new marketing campaign featuring former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, Adidas reportedly unveiled former police officer Darren Wilson Tuesday as the new face of the brand. “Darren Wilson represents the values that Adidas stands for—the values of true-blue, patriotic Americans,” said spokesperson Victor Donnelly at a press conference where Adidas displayed a new 30-second black-and-white ad spot featuring close-ups of Wilson, Timothy Loehmann, John Rogers, Andrew Hutchins, and several other police officers who were acquitted in the shooting deaths of unarmed African American men with the new slogan “Believe You’ll Walk Away Scot-Free” superimposed over their faces. “Whether you’re walking carefully through a crime scene to plant a gun on someone or sprinting after a suspect so you can shoot him in the back, Adidas offers the most comfortable, form-fitting, breathable attire for high-performance police work. In these controversial times, brands like Adidas must take a stand, and wherever you go from now on, if you hear or see the word ‘Adidas,’ we want you to think of Darren Wilson.” At press time, Adidas’ stock price was soaring after a massive increase in sales.
